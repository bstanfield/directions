<p><strong>In One Ear</strong> <br />
<br>
<br>
They say that we ain't got the style <br />
We ain't got the class <br />
We ain't got the tunes that's <br />
Gonna put us on the map <br />
And I'm a phony in disguise <br />
Tryin' to make the radio <br />
I'm an anti-social anarchist <br />
I sound like so and so</p>

<p>They say I'm just a stupid kid <br />
Another crazy radical <br />
Rock'n'roll is dead <br />
I probably should have stayed in school <br />
Another generation X <br />
Who somehow slipped up through the cracks
Oh they'd love to see me fall
But I'm already on my back</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong>: 
<br></p>

<p>So it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand</p>

<p>Now I know I'm not a saint
I've been a sinner all my life
I ain't tryin' to hide my flaws
I'd rather keep them in the light
They want to criticize, scrutinize
Cast another stone
Burn me at the stake
And sit and watch it from their throne</p>

<p>They say the devil is my pal
I do a lot of drugs
The crowd will only like me
If they're really fuckin' drunk
They think they know my thoughts
But they don't know the least
If they'd listen to the words
They'd find a message tucked beneath</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong>: <br />
<br>
But it goes in one ear, and right out the other,
People talkin’ shit, even though they never bother,
It goes in one ear, and right out the other,
People talkin’ shit, they can kiss the back of my hand!</p>

<p>You hear that?
You hear what's coming?
Oh, you better run for the hills
'Cause we're coming to your town
And we're gonna burn that motherfucker down</p>

<p>Here's the moral to the story
We don't do it for the glory
We don't do it for the money
We don't do it for the fame
So all the critics who despise us
Go ahead and criticize us
It's your tyranny that drives us
Adds the fire to our flames</p>

<p>And it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit so you know we never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
I'm only playing music 'cause you know I fucking love it
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand</p>
