<h1> In One Ear </h1>

<h2>by Cage the Elephant</h2>

<p><strong>In One Ear</strong> <br />
<br>
<br>
They say that we ain't got the style <br />
We ain't got the class <br />
We ain't got the tunes that's <br />
Gonna put us on the map <br />
And I'm a phony in disguise <br />
Tryin' to make the radio <br />
I'm an anti-social anarchist <br />
I sound like so and so</p>

<p>They say I'm just a stupid kid <br />
Another crazy radical <br />
Rock'n'roll is dead <br />
I probably should have stayed in school <br />
Another generation X <br />
Who somehow slipped up through the cracks <br />
Oh they'd love to see me fall <br />
But I'm already on my back</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong>: 
<br></p>

<p>So it goes in one ear and right out the other <br />
People talking shit but you know I never bother <br />
It goes in one ear and right out the other <br />
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand</p>

<p>Now I know I'm not a saint <br />
I've been a sinner all my life <br />
I ain't tryin' to hide my flaws <br />
I'd rather keep them in the light <br />
They want to criticize, scrutinize  <br />
Cast another stone <br />
Burn me at the stake <br />
And sit and watch it from their throne</p>

<p>They say the devil is my pal
I do a lot of drugs <br />
The crowd will only like me <br />
If they're really fuckin' drunk <br />
They think they know my thoughts <br />
But they don't know the least <br />
If they'd listen to the words <br />
They'd find a message tucked beneath</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong>: <br />
<br>
But it goes in one ear, and right out the other <br />
People talkin’ shit, even though they never bother, <br />
It goes in one ear, and right out the other, <br />
People talkin’ shit, they can kiss the back of my hand!</p>

<p>You hear that? <br />
You hear what's coming? <br />
Oh, you better run for the hills <br />
'Cause we're coming to your town <br />
And we're gonna burn that motherfucker down</p>

<p>Here's the moral to the story <br />
We don't do it for the glory <br />
We don't do it for the money   <br />
We don't do it for the fame <br />
So all the critics who despise us <br />
Go ahead and criticize us <br />
It's your tyranny that drives us  <br />
Adds the fire to our flames</p>

<p>And it goes in one ear and right out the other <br />
People talking shit so you know we never bother <br />
It goes in one ear and right out the other <br />
I'm only playing music 'cause you know I fucking love it <br />
It goes in one ear and right out the other <br />
People talking shit but you know I never bother <br />
It goes in one ear and right out the other <br />
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand</p>

 <p><strong>In One Ear</strong> <br />
