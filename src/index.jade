                    At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
                    Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn,
                    was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch&mdash;then headed by
                    Flask&mdash;was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly&mdash;like
                    half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod's murdered
                    Innocents&mdash;that one and all, they started from their reveries, and for the
                    space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all transfixedly listening, like
                    the carved Roman slave, while that wild cry remained within hearing. The
                    Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered;
                    but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman&mdash;the
                    oldest mariner of all&mdash;declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were
                    heard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.

                    Steering now south-eastward by Ahab's levelled steel, and her progress solely
                    determined by Ahab's level log and line; the Pequod held on her path towards
                    the Equator. Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters,
                    descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds,
                    over waves monotonously mild; all these seemed the strange calm things
                    preluding some riotous and desperate scene.
